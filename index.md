### About Me

I have a B.Sc. in Control and Automation from the University of Brasilia (UnB), and a M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). Currently, I am a PhD Student in the team LARSEN at INRIA Nancy under the supervision of  [Dr. Jean-Baptiste Mouret](https://members.loria.fr/JBMouret/), and [Dr. Serena Ivaldi](https://members.loria.fr/Sivaldi/).

### Research

My thesis subject is **"Intelligent cooperation between humans and robots"**. The research aims to use knowledge of **human motor control** and **machine learning** to **control** the **whole body** of a **humanoid** robot (__iCub__) that cooperates seemlessly with a human partner to execute a certain task.
