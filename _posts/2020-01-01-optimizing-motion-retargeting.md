## Optimizing Motion Retargeting

Happy new year everybody!

For this 2020, I decided to keep more and more updates coming to the blog. And as the first post of the year, why not a belated "paper update"?

This last october, on behalf of my colleagues and co-authors, I presented the work "Humanoid Whole-Body Movement Optimization from Retargeted Human Motions" at the Humanoids 2019 conference in Toronto! Sounds exciting right? Yes, it was! A great opportunity to connect with other roboticists, and people that face similar (or even identical) challenges as mine!

Did the title of our paper enticed your curiosity? Have a look at our youtube video below! or click on [my publications link](https://waldezjr.github.io/publications/) !
