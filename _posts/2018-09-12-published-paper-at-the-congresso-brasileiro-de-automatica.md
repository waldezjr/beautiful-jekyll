## My first robotics paper!

My first paper in robotics was just made public in the proceedings for the brazilian conference **Congresso Brasileiro de Automatica 2018** that happened this week in Joao Pessoa in Brazil.

The Paper entitled "**Role Adaptive Admittance Controller for Human-Robot Co-Manipulation**" is also co-authored by Dr Fernando Lizarralde, who was my advisor when I was a M.Sc. student.

The work is about a robot controller that aims to help humans in different ways, either to follow or lead the way for its human partner.

This is just an early work on this theme, hopefully I will get a lot more going and be able to talk about it here.

The whole process of development of the controller, implementing algorithms, and writing the paper was very challenging and rewarding. If you wanna take a look at the implementations please check these repos:

And finally, the link to download the paper PDF is also in [my publications page](https://waldezjr.github.io/publications/).
