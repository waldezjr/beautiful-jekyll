# How to write a simple Linear Program with an AbstractModel in Pyomo (wip)
## Content
This tutorial contains step-by-step explanations and a live example using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) alongside with a folder from [my GitHub page](https://github.com/waldezjr/PyomoExampleNotebooks)

> This tutorial provides a hands-on approach to introduce the user to Pyomo, but by no means it intends to provide a complete understanding of the library.
> For more information on Pyomo, the [Pyomo Documentation](https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pyomo_overview/index.html) is a great first step.


## Goals of this tutorial

1. Show a simple and efficient file organization for solving a linear program with a [Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/) AbstractModel class.

2. Show how to write a data file (.dat) for pyomo usage

3. Shows a simple AbstractModel example

4. Shows a script to instantiate your LP model, and optimize it with Pyomo.
